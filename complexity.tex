\begin{proposition}
	The following problem is decidable in \pspace:
	Given a "PPUD" $\mathcal{P}$ and two "configurations" $\config_1, \config_2$, is there a "run" from $\config_1$ to $\config_2$?
\end{proposition}




\begin{theorem}
	The following problem is decidable in \exps for all fixed $k$:
	
	Given an "IOPPUD" $\mathcal{P}$ and a "specification" $\phi$ with $k$ quantifiers, does $\mathcal{P}$ satisfy $\phi$?
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
	The well-specification problem is \nexpt-hard for "IOPPUD".
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}
	Correctness and well-specification are decidable in \exps and \nexpt-hard for "IOPPUD".
\end{corollary}

\begin{theorem}
	The well-specification problem is undecidable for "PPUD".
\end{theorem}
